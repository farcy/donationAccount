                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2"> Thousands of people have fled for safety, while millions have been left stranded due to the monsoon floods across the region, with dozens tragically having lost their lives.

                    Each year, heavy monsoon rains threaten millions of lives across South Asia. This year’s monsoon season is getting worse by the day, causing widespread damage across Bangladesh. Communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and lack access to essential food, water, and basic medical assistance.
                    
                
                    Penny Appeal is working with partners on the ground to provide life-saving support to those whose lives have been torn apart this monsoon season.</p>

In this regard, with the support of Habitat For Humanity, HEED Bangladesh implemented a project named “Northeastern Bangladesh Flood Response Project-2022”. The project was funded by the Disaster Relief Fund, the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and the Tithe. The main Goal of this short-term project was to provide the essential household materials and house-Building tools where 22 items were included to the people who are dreadfully</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement, also known as the July Revolution,[d] was a series of anti-government[e] and pro-democracy[f] protests in Bangladesh, spearheaded primarily by university students. Initially focused on restructuring quota-based systems for government job recruitment, the movement expanded against what many perceive as an authoritarian government when they carried out the July massacre of protestors and civilians, most of whom were students.[g]

                    The protest began in June 2024, in response to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reinstating a 30% quota for descendants of freedom fighters, reversing the government decision made in response to the 2018 Bangladesh quota reform movement</p>
